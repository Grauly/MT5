# MT5
A Polymer based server-side mod that add a variety of weapons.

## History

My History of writing plugins for guns goes back some time, almost to the beginning of me writing plugins. MT4 was the first iteration of this, being made to originally add Lightsabers for May the fourth.


Well, that spiraled into the first gun code, and very soon I started a rewrite, MTF. MTF did not only add guns, but a variety of features as well, a good part of which I intend to port over to MT5.
Lets just say that the code for MTF has aged... alot. It was originally written for 1.16 and is starting to show its age, with features broken and forgotten.
